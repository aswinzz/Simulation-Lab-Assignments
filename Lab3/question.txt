The problem is to be simulated for n days where on each day their is some demand for the merchandise.

You have to find the cost for policy (which means given values of P and Q). The stock on first day is 115 (given in above pic).

Please note that new stocks are ordered whenever the stock is less than or equal to P. Value of Q will always be greater than P.

Readability of code will carry 20% weightage of marks.

Dry run for given sample case initial inventory (given) = 115

day	demand	stocks left after fulfilling demand	cost of inventory	if ordered	total cost
1	60	55	55 * 0.75	55+0 < 100, ordered	55 * 0.75 + 75
2	50	5	5 * 0.75	5+150 > 100	5 * 0.75
3	60	0	55 * 18	0+150 = 100	55 * 18
4	70	80	80 * 0.75	80+0 < 100, ordered	80 * 0.75 + 75
5	10	70	70 * 0.75	70+150 > 100	70 * 0.75
55 * 0.75 + 75 + 5 * 0.75 + 55 * 18 + 80 * 0.75 + 75 + 70 * 0.75
= 1297.5
Input Format

First line contains the number a n - the days you have to run the simulation.

Second line contains a pair of integers indicating the policy - P and Q.

Third line contains n integers which tells the demand for merchandise on each day.

Constraints

None
